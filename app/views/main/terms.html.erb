    <h2>Our Plan</h2>

    <p>In addition to the current web pages we provide, we will also introduce a series of features which will significantly boost our user experience. First, we will set up the user account for each of the unique user, and we will also provide them login options including Facebook and Weibo account authentication. With identification included, users will be able to leave a comment in each our posts so that we can answer their doubts or discuss our interests together. Moreover, we will also construct seamless communication to allows users to share their ideas or discuss their opinions. </p>

    <p>In our current stage, our primary concern would be accumulating hit-rate for our website across all the social media platforms, and when the time comes, we will also set up E-Commerce marketplace to propagate and sell the latest sneakers series. Cheers.</p>
