# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  About_Us: "About Us"
  about_us_1: "Hi this is the <strong><i>Kicks4Love鞋侣</i></strong> team, we are a group of sneaker enthusiasts aiming to provide users with the latest sneaker release date as well as posts regarding the most popular trend. Currently we are still under development stage, which means there could still be some defects and bugs which we are not aware of. If that ever happens, feel free to get in touch with us and tell us what you think about our product. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated : )"
  about_us_2: "Our Plan"
  about_us_3: "In addition to the current pages we provide, we will also introduce a series of features which will significantly boost our user experience. First, we will set up user accounts for each unique user, and we will also implement login options including <a href=\"https://facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://weibo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Weibo</a> account authentication. With identification included, users will be able to leave comments in each of our posts so that we can answer their doubts or discuss interesting topics together. Moreover, we will also construct seamless communication to allow users to share their ideas or discuss their opinions.<br><br>In our current stage, our primary concern would be accumulating hit-rate for our website across all the social media platforms, and when the time comes, we will also set up E-Commerce marketplace to propagate and sell the latest sneakers series. Cheers!!!"
